Before the visit to UTM Digital, I had no idea about what or where it was located. I am very glad that there was an opportunity for me to visit UTM Digital, and I got to know more about this place. UTM Digital comprises units such as Open Office, Digital Care, TM Room and Data Centre. The overall working environment is very pleasant, and the workers are equipped with high-tech facilities.

During the visit, I learned that the services at UTM Digital primarily focus on solving students' issues, such as problems with the UTM Smart application, Wi-Fi issues, and handling various complaints. Additionally, my team members and I had the privilege of interviewing Mr. Raziman, a senior IT officer in UTMDigital. His valuable insights during the interview session significantly changed my mindset and provided a deeper understanding of UTMDigitalâ€™s operations.

The faculty members who accompanied us were approachable, friendly, and nice. They provided us with detailed explanations for each area within UTM Digital. I was particularly impressed by the high-tech facilities used in various units.

The open office concept at UTM Digital is different from traditional offices, which encouraging the workers to have open discussions at any time. This innovative approach fosters a collaborative work environment, allowing for seamless communication among team members. The workspace contributes to a positive and productive atmosphere for the workers in UTMDigital.

In conclusion, the visit to UTM Digital not only expanded my knowledge about the institution but also showcased the excellent services provided by the staff to students. The high-tech facilities, coupled with the open and collaborative working environment, impressed me a lot. Now I also wish to work in UTMDigital!!
